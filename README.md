# NUCLEO-144
NUCLEO-144 Repository for STMIcroelectronics NUCLEO-144 STM32F746ZG Dev Board.  This is a library of Arduino like functions written for this particular board.

This code is compiled using the JumpStart C++ for Cortex Ver 9.12 which can be demoed for free at www.imagecraft.com or a non-commercial license can be purchased for $50.  I used the free 45 day demo.  They include a JumpStart API which makes it very easy to get up and started.  JumpStart is also an IDE that is using the GNU ARM Compiler.  THere is no setting up your build enviornment you just install it, open it, choose what you are going to do, choose the target, and your up and running.
